# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory
  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description 

  I used a free template from Tim Baker and their components to create this more uniform contemporary portfolio page. I continued with the one portfolio page that scrolls with links to projects, an about page and a contact page. The email is not working, but that will be fixed in a later edition.
